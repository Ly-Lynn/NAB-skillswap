# üîé Search Function Documentation

<a name="search"></a>

## Realtime search issue:

The list can render simultaneously with user interactions ‚Üí useEffect is triggered every time the user interacts with the search name or search skills component, automatically calling the API.

‚Üí New issue: continuously calling the API can cause slow rendering, lag, or even ‚Äúcrash‚Äù if the user list is too long.

‚Üí Possible approach: fetch all users once ‚Üí store them in a variable ‚Üí filter the list on the frontend.  
‚Üí Drawback: this only works for an MVP, because if the dataset grows too large, the response payload becomes too heavy, slowing down the API call.

‚Üí Better approach: call the API with input query params, meaning the user types, and the API request includes the query. The response then only includes the filtered/searched data.  
‚Üí But this returns to the original problem of calling the API continuously, now even more frequently due to rapid user interactions.

‚Üí Solution: use **debounce** to space out the API call frequency. In the code, it‚Äôs set to 500ms/call ‚Äî meaning after 500ms, the API will only be called once, regardless of how many times the user types/interacts. It always takes the latest result every 500ms to send the request to the server.

**Note (this may come up as a question):** The drawback is similar to the above approach ‚Äî if scaled to big data, the response can still be too large.  
A solution here is to apply **pagination** on the backend, so the response only returns a set number of users based on the page selected on the frontend (for example, page 1 only returns the top 10 users).
