# 🔎 Search Function Documentation

<a name="search"></a>

## Realtime search issue:

The list can render simultaneously with user interactions → useEffect is triggered every time the user interacts with the search name or search skills component, automatically calling the API.

→ New issue: continuously calling the API can cause slow rendering, lag, or even "crash" if the user list is too long.

→ Possible approach: fetch all users once → store them in a variable → filter the list on the frontend.  
→ Drawback: this only works for an MVP, because if the dataset grows too large, the response payload becomes too heavy, slowing down the API call.

→ Better approach: call the API with input query params, meaning the user types, and the API request includes the query. The response then only includes the filtered/searched data.  
→ But this returns to the original problem of calling the API continuously, now even more frequently due to rapid user interactions.

→ Solution: use **debounce** to space out the API call frequency. In the code, it's set to 500ms/call — meaning after 500ms, the API will only be called once, regardless of how many times the user types/interacts. It always takes the latest result every 500ms to send the request to the server.

**Note (this may come up as a question):** The drawback is similar to the above approach — if scaled to big data, the response can still be too large.  
A solution here is to apply **pagination** on the backend, so the response only returns a set number of users based on the page selected on the frontend (for example, page 1 only returns the top 10 users).
